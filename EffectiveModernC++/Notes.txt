rvalue:
	Object that can't be assigned to.
	Has a temporary lifetime that ends when the statement it is contained within is over.
	Can be moved from.

Move Semantics:
	move ctor and move assignment operator.
	Work with rvalues to allow moving of values from one object to another.


Perfect Forwarding:
	rvalue and lvalue arguments are passed to functions, binding to their parameters.
	Depending on the parameter type:
		Lvalue, argument is copied
		Lvalue ref, argument is passed by reference
		Rvalue ref, argument is passed by reference

	Regardless of how the argument is passed to the parameter, the parameter itself is an lvalue.
	This means that forwarding an argument through a function to another one will always end up passing an lvalue to the next function.

	Perfect Forwarding allows us to get the type of the original argument and give that to the next function
