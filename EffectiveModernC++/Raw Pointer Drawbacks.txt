Cons that Raw Pointers have:

1) Declaration doesn't inform you if it points to single element or array of elements.

2) Declaration doesn't inform you if you are responsible for deleting or not. (No Ownership context)

3) Has no way of telling you how you should destroy the object pointer to. Delete or pass to a function?

4) No way to know if delete or delete[]

5) Hard to ensure delete only called once on all execution paths

6) No way to acertain if pointer is dangling
